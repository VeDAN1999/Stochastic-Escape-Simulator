# Stochastic-Escape-Simulator
This repository contains a numerical and analytical study of escape rates in a one-dimensional stochastic system modeled by a quartic potential as an example. The code simulates noisy trajectories escaping from a metastable well under varying noise intensities and compares:
- Numerical escape rates from stochastic simulations
- Kramers' approximation (semiclassical rate formula)
- Exact escape rates computed via a double integral formulation
